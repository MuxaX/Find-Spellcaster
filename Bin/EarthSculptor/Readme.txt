EearthSculptor Beta 1.0

Real Time 3D Terrain Heightmap Editor and Painter

If your having problems running the application, make sure you have proper video card drivers installed on your machine. Earthsculptor takes advantage of vertex/pixel shaders, multiple texture units and push buffers(rendertargets) using OpenGL.

KEYS (based on my fps key controls) if your having trouble with the keys you can always switch to WASD keys or remap the keys in the Camera menu.
